## Values as a Developer

### Find the root of the problem.

It's so easy to say that I don't know why but it works. I don't deny I did that. But I try not to do that again, even if it means to track down the ugly code inside `node_modules` folder.

### Code isn't done when tests aren't written.

Writing tests means writing more code and spending more time. But they are worth it because:

1. Tests make me think the correct inputs/outputs and where is the right place for the code.
2. Tests alert me when I break other things.

### Welcome the feedbacks. But don't automatically follow it. 

I love feedbacks. I always learn valuable lessons from them. But it doesn't mean I have to follow everything in them. I also need to verify them. It's because sometimes the better answer is hidden somewhere between.

### Experiment and Learn

If I cannot do something, it's maybe because I don't have enough knowledge or clue. And the fastest way to get them is to experiment things or learn the topic.

### Try not to make the same mistake again

If I did something wrong, it means that I can do the same wrong thing again. I must be extra careful about them.

### Don't forget where I started.

I could do and write all of these because I've learned them from someone else. Don't forget them and be a good teacher and person like them.

## Current Focus

What I'm learning:

* Chrome Dev Tools

What I'm working on:

* Cypress: fixing bugs with the tag, [internal priority](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/labels/pkg%2Fdriver).
* Ghost: fix bugs.
* Preparing YouTube Channel for beginners.
